"Truth can only be found in one place: the code"
 
 --Robert C. Martin


Greetings everyone.

CSEC is back with yet another intriguing and edifying chapter of hackathon "Hack 3.0", it will be a perfect opportunity for those seeking to apply their knowledge to hands-on projects and for those eager to venture into new areas of computing and learn new skills. Our previous hackathons have seen the participation of the best of hackers and programmers from various colleges with creative ideas and innovative projects, but this year we are expecting the competition on a whole new level as the growth of our hackathon has been exponential.

It will give you an opportunity to brainstorm ingenious ideas and implement them into real-life projects. Being a team event, it will help you gain experience of teamwork and allow you to showcase your potential while competing with the best of minds. Students from all branches who have a knack for learning outside the classrooms are equally welcome to participate in the hackathon. The inexperienced students who wish to participate will be provided with mentors to guide them and to seek help from throughout their project. 

It will be a two-day event starting on 9th of February. Teams will be provided with the perfect working environment for developing the projects and the top 3 winning teams will receive generous prizes. The focal point of the event is the amount of knowledge you will gain working on a real-life application of theoretical concepts. College subjects and classes even though provide us with a plethora of knowledge, but hardly gives us any clue and a very narrow window for application of the taught concepts. Hackathon will be a perfect opportunity to implement your concepts and be as creative and innovative as you can be. 

We hope that this hackathon will serve as a great opportunity for all those who are willing to learn, build and develop their crazy ideas into reality and win prizes and recognition for the same. 

## Rules:
#### Team of maximum 4 members is allowed 
#### Maximum of 2 members can be from third year 
#### For final year limit is 1 member per team 
#### Have to finish your project by the 4:00 pm of 4th feb 
#### Judges decision will be final 

## How it works

People from final year and third year have graciously agreed to mentor people from second and first year
(if needed). So, students from second and third year who want to maybe learn new technologies can take part
in the hackathon by joining the team of a mentor. Of course, you still have the choice of doing it alone,
but please make sure your team does not have more than 4 members.
