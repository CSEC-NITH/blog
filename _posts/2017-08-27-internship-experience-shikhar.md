This is yet another post about Internships.
The students from our college have got foreign research internship in different Institutes through Mitacs, Daad, etc in past but this is the first time someone got a foreign industrial internship in a tech company. These two are quite different, both in application and the work involved. I am writing this post to share my experience working as a Software Engineering Intern for 12 weeks in summer of 2017 at Bloomberg L.P. at their London office.

## Application
During the 5th semester of my studies as a Computer Science student at NIT Hamirpur, I was looking for an internship. It was a really long process and took almost all of my 3rd year. I applied to various places during my 5th and 6th semester and gave almost 20 interviews in total for -
1) Google MTV - USA
2) Amazon Alexa - Poland
3) Amazon AWS - Germany
4) Amazon - India
5) Bloomberg L.P. - UK
6) Intugine Technologies - India
7) Instaroid - Singapore
8) Positive Energy A.S. - Turkey

Some of them did not sync with the summer break we have in our college (Dates and Duration) while some required more time for completion. In the end, the ones which synced correctly and I was able to secure offer from were -
1) Amazon AWS - Germany
2) Bloomberg L.P. - UK
3) Intugine Technologies - India
4) Positive Energy A.S. - Turkey

I decided to go with Bloomberg L.P. as it seemed most suitable option at that time (Also it paid the most ;) ). To get more information on the application process you can check out [How to apply off campus](http://csec.nith.ac.in/blog/2017/08/11/how-to-apply-off-campus.html) .

# Interviews
I will be sharing the interview experience with Bloomberg L.P. . All the major tech organisations have the same hiring process.
There were a total of 5 rounds of interviews with Bloomberg for the position. The hiring process is exactly same for interns and full time hire. I remember sitting with MS graduates during the onsite interviews. Everything, from the level of difficulty to the number and duration of interviews is same for interns and full time hires. Five rounds were in the order -
1) Technical phone interview (1 hour) (One on One). 
2) Technical video conference interview (1.5 hours) (Two on One)
3) Technical Onsite interview 1 (1.5 hours) (Three on One)
4) Technical Onsite interview 2 (1.5 hours) (One on One)
5) H.R Onsite interview (30 min) (One on One)

All the technical rounds involved solving coding/system design problems on a screen shared with the interviewers. You need to have strong knowledge of Computer Science Fundamentals to get through them.

# Travel
Bloomberg provided the airfare from New Delhi to London for the internship and the onsite interviews.

# Housing
The Bloomberg office is situated right in the center of the city. London is one of the most expensive cities to live in the world and the cost of living is really high. The office being situated right in the center of the were city made finding an affordable housing really difficult. The London office doesn't provide any corporate housing so it provides a sum of money to the interns to find housing themselves. It also helps you finding the house by providing you membership for some of the best flat sharing websites which comes with added benefits.
 
This made the moving process really smooth once I found the right place to stay for 12 weeks. I was lucky to find a place near the office (20 min walk) which saved a lot of commute time. It was a flat share with 3 other flat mates from different places . 

# Office
The Bloomberg London office is situated in the center of the city. The office was 20 min walk from the place where I stayed. 
The office itself had an open office floor plan and all meeting rooms had glass walls in accordance with the company's policy of transparency. The office was really beautiful with at least one large aquarium on each floor. Breakfast was provided for free to all employees and had a large number of options to choose from (Breads, Cereals, Yoghurt, Toast, Fruits, etc). The dinner was provided between 8 - 9 PM on two weekdays and was always something great (Sushi, Burritos, etc). The pantry was well stocked with lots of snacks, fruits and drinks available 24x7.

There were a lot of restaurants and food courts nearby (Eat, Pret a Manger, Costa, etc) where you can find lunch under 10 pounds.

# Salary
Bloomberg provides airfare for the internship and stipend for housing in London. The salary is very competitive and at the time of writing the interns here are paid more than interns at Google, Amazon and Microsoft.

# Work
As an intern, the work at Bloomberg was really exciting. The interns are given significant projects to work on and have full freedom to choose the implementation with a mentor assigned to each intern. The interns are treated just like a full time employee and hence and given the same level of responsibilities and ownership.  They really try to match your interest and assign you to a team accordingly. 
I worked with a team and my project was mostly C++ and some Python.
There were also a lot of intern events (1-2 events every week) for interns to interact and share experiences. There were a lot of interns and I was the only intern from India there at that time :P . 
The work hours were flexible with most people working from 8:30 - 6:00 . Interns were not encouraged to work long hours and hence were not given permission to work from home.
Bloomberg also oganizes a summer party every year which is like a big free carnival for its employees and their family.

All in all the work during the internship was great.

# London
I think the city of London is also a major reason for a great internship experience. London is multicultural city where you can get the feels and vibes of entire Europe. Although the cost of living is really high, it has some of the best facilities in the world.
From one of the best public transport system to great restaurants, London has it all.
I explored new places every weekend ranging from great museums in London to Loch Ness in Scotland.
It made the overall intern experience really awesome.
