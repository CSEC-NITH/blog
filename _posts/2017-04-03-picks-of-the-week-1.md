Here are some questions that we recommend people who are interested in competitive coding should check out this week.

## [TEST](http://www.spoj.com/problems/TEST/)

Recommended by: [Param Singh](http://codeforces.com/profile/prmsngh)

This problem is THE first problem that any competitive coder solves. Even the best among the best make mistakes when they [start out](https://www.codechef.com/status/TEST,codeextractor) . Everyone should try this one out at least.

Binary search is hard to get right. People think that it only involves finding an element in a sorted array but it opens up a whole new segment of problems when you truly understand it. This is a great problem to start off with.

Here is a great tutorial to familiarize yourself with Binary Search and it's greater uses: [https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/binary-search/](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/binary-search/)

This is the first problem that anyone studying Dynamic Programming should start with. It introduces concepts of memoization and helps you in thinking recursively.

For an introduction to what Dynamic Programming is, check out this link: [https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/)

Dynamic Programming is one of the most important sub-parts of competitive coding. CP is all about DP.
Martian Mining is a very interesting problem that took me and Param a long time to solve. But after seeing the solution, it was crystal clear. It really helped us in understanding how to approach Dynamic Programming problems.
