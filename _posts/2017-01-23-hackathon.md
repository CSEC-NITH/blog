We're organizing a hackathon on February 4th and 5th, 2017 and welcome as much participation
from the college as possible. It will involve people working in teams over a period of two days to try to
create a project that can be used by end users.

## How it works

People from final year and third year have graciously agreed to mentor people from second and first year
(if needed). So, students from second and third year who want to maybe learn new technologies can take part
in the hackathon by joining the team of a mentor. Of course, you still have the choice of going it alone,
but please make sure your team does not have more than 5 members. The list of teams from third and final year,
along with their projects (or the tech they intend to use) is as follows:

* **Nishant Chaudhary / Shyam Agarwal** - Java / Android
* **Ankit Sachan** - Java / Android, location based service to identify your MLAs (for elections)
* **Param Singh** -  C++ / Python / Java
