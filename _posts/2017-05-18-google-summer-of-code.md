This is a mirror of the Facebook GLUG-NITH post I wrote about NITH's performance in GSoC 2017. Here is the original post: [https://www.facebook.com/glug.nith/posts/1490507337658980](https://www.facebook.com/glug.nith/posts/1490507337658980)

So uh, don't know if people heard it but [GSoC 2017](http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) results came out yesterday and we did better than last year, which is an accomplishment in itself! 6 people were selected to work on varied open source projects this year from our college.

1. [Abhishek Rastogi](https://github.com/Princu7): Abhishek will be working on the open-event-webapp project for FOSSASIA. [Project link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4702452784824320). Congrats!

2. [Anishka Gupta](https://github.com/Anishka0107): Anishka has the most technical proposal we've read. She'll be helping out people at the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ([link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5414049213841408)). Congratulations Anishka for being the first girl GSoCer in NITH. You're an inspiration to everyone!

3. [Bimalkant Lauhny](https://github.com/code-master5): Bimal will be working for openSUSE, improving their Jangouts project which is a very impressive alternative to Hangouts. [Link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4710360429887488)

4. [Kumar Shashwat](https://github.com/octacode): Shashwat is gonna work with Amahi to add lots of features to their Android app! Go check it out, it's really cool! [Link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5171594881138688)

5. [Param Singh](https://github.com/paramsingh): Param is gonna work with people in the MetaBrainz Foundation to hack on the ListenBrainz project with some cool data architecture and visualization! [Link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6609129159262208)

6. [Suyash Garg](https://github.com/ferbncode): Suyash is also working with the MetaBrainz Foundation, helping out to fix the way they retrieve data in their CritiqueBrainz project. Lots of SQL will be involved. :) [Link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5759379274989568)

Also, special mention to [Lokesh Sharma](https://github.com/lokeshh), who is mentoring two different projects for the Ruby Science Foundation this year. To all prospective students next year, you know where to go, hint hint. ;)

So yeah, 6 student projects and 1 mentor is a pretty good showing. Congratulations to everyone involved! Especially to the 4 people from CSEC. To all the people reading this, you know which club to join next year. ;)

Here's to an even better performance next year!
