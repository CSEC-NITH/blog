Hello peeps. We're organizing a hackathon on February 3th and 4th, 2018 which is powered by Hackerearth and welcome as much participation
from the college as possible. It will involve people working in teams over a period of two days to try to
create a project that can be used by end users.

## Rules:
#### Team of maximum 4 members is allowed 
#### Maximum of 2 members can be from third year 
#### For final year limit is 1 member per team 
#### Have to finish your project by the 4:00 pm of 4th feb 
#### Judges decision will be final 

## How it works

People from final year and third year have graciously agreed to mentor people from second and first year
(if needed). So, students from second and third year who want to maybe learn new technologies can take part
in the hackathon by joining the team of a mentor. Of course, you still have the choice of going it alone,
but please make sure your team does not have more than 4 members.

List of mentors will be uploaded soon , along with their skills.
